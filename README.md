# CustomAndroidMVVM
Sample code for Android custom MVVM + Data Binding + OkHTTP + Retrofit + Dagger

## Synopsis
I write this code, just want to try to convert my friends [Clean Code MVP](https://github.com/ennur/Clean-Android-Code) project into custom MVVM pattern 
and put data binding on it. Why my MVVM project using *presenter*? That's why i called it custom, and it make easier for me
to write unit test, by splitting logic class and ui class.

## Library Used
1. [Dagger 2](https://github.com/google/dagger)
2. [Retrofit 2](https://github.com/square/retrofit)
3. [okHttp](https://github.com/square/okhttp)

## Android Test Library
1. Espresso
2. Mockito

## API
i use Apiary from my friends which is used on his tutorial [Clean Code MVP](https://github.com/ennur/Clean-Android-Code)
